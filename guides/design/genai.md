# GenAI Infrastructure: Design and Implementation

This document describes the design and operation of the GenAI infrastructure within Torus. This infrastructure provides flexible, runtime-configurable support for integrating multiple GenAI models from various providers, enabling features to leverage different models depending on system-level or course-section-level configurations.

## Key Capabilities

The GenAI infrastructure is designed with several core capabilities:

- **Dynamic Model Integration**: Runtime support for registering and utilizing models from multiple providers, including OpenAI, Claude, or any provider with an OpenAI-compliant API.
- **Feature-Specific Model Usage**: Different GenAI features within Torus can independently use different registered models.
- **Course-Section-Level Customization**: The ability to override default models at the individual course section level.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Robust handling of provider errors through a backup model configuration, ensuring system reliability.
- **Reusable Dialogue Implementation**: A clean, modular GenServer-based dialogue component suitable for use across multiple features.

## Architectural Components

### Completions Service and Provider Behavior

The core interface for interacting with GenAI models is the `Oli.GenAI.Completions` service. This module dynamically dispatches completion requests through its `generate/3` and `stream/4` functions to specific provider implementations based on configuration.

Three provider implementations currently exist:

- `Oli.GenAI.Completions.OpenAICompliantProvider`
- `Oli.GenAI.Completions.ClaudeProvider`
- `Oli.GenAI.Completions.NullProvider` (a placeholder used for development and testing)

### Registered Models

Models from GenAI providers are represented within the system using the `RegisteredModel` schema. This schema captures essential details such as provider type, model name, and the API endpoint (`url_template`). Administrators will be able to dynamically register new models via an upcoming administrative interface.

Example registrations:

```elixir
%RegisteredModel{provider: :openai, model: "gpt-4-1106-preview", url_template: "https://api.openai.com"}
%RegisteredModel{provider: :openai, model: "gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27", url_template: "https://api.openai.com"}
%RegisteredModel{provider: :claude, model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307", url_template: "https://api.anthropic.com"}
%RegisteredModel{provider: :openai, model: "my-fine-tuned-gemini", url_template: "https://server.undermydesk.com"}
```

The infrastructure supports integration of official foundation models and self-hosted or fine-tuned solutions seamlessly.

### Service Configuration (`ServiceConfig`)
Each GenAI-driven feature in Torus is configured through a `ServiceConfig`. A service configuration defines a primary registered model to use for a feature and can optionally specify a backup model as a fallback. This ensures graceful degradation of service if the primary provider becomes unavailable or returns an error.

### Feature-Level Configuration (`GenAIFeatureConfig`)
The GenAIFeatureConfig schema associates GenAI-powered features (like student dialogue or instructor dashboards) with specific ServiceConfig instances. It allows setting a global default for each feature, with the option for individual course sections to override this default.

The schema is straightforward:

```
schema "gen_ai_feature_configs" do
  field(:feature, Ecto.Enum, values: [:student_dialogue, :instructor_dashboard])
  belongs_to :service_config, Oli.GenAI.Completions.ServiceConfig
  belongs_to :section, Oli.Delivery.Sections.Section

  timestamps(type: :utc_datetime)
end
```

For instance, the system might define a global default where the student dialogue feature (`:student_dialogue`) uses OpenAI's GPT-4 by default, with a Claude model as a fallback. A specific course section (e.g., REAL CHEM) could then override this to use a fine-tuned Gemini model, specifying OpenAI as the backup.

When a feature initializes (such as the DOT component), it retrieves both the global default and any section-specific configuration. It prioritizes the section-specific configuration, falling back to the global default as necessary.

### Dialogue Management via GenServer (`Oli.GenAI.Dialogue.Server`)
The multi-turn dialogue implementation previously embedded within UI components has been extracted into a standalone GenServer (Oli.GenAI.Dialogue.Server). This GenServer manages the lifecycle of GenAI dialoguesâ€”processing messages, handling streaming responses from GenAI providers, and dispatching tokens back to UI processes (typically Phoenix LiveView components). This modular design allows easy reuse and maintains a clear separation of concerns.

### Database Initialization and Environment Variables
When setting up or resetting the database (mix ecto.reset), migrations automatically detect environment variables for API keys (OpenAI and Anthropic). If these keys are present, appropriate RegisteredModel and ServiceConfig records are created. If absent, the system defaults to using the NullProvider, which provides basic responses for development purposes.

This design ensures that in production environments (such as Proton or Stellarator), real provider configurations will automatically be established, whereas in local or development setups, the system gracefully defaults to a no-operation provider.

### Planned Enhancements

The present design deliberately maintains backward compatibility. Deploying this infrastructure will not affect previous GenAI functionality, as default configurations replicate existing behavior, with new capabilities becoming available incrementally as administrators and course authors configure them through the forthcoming UI.

Future features (instructor facing DOT, authoring agent) will add new entries into the `Ecto.Enum` of `:features` in the `GenAIFeatureConfig` schema and default `ServiceConfig` references.
