The following lists the various types of resources that exist:\n\n- _Container_: A collection of pages or containers that can correspond to \"Units\" or \"Modules\" within a course.\n- _Page_: A collection of content and activities that offer student instruction and assessment. Pages can be either \"graded\" or \"practice\".\n- _Activity_: A scorable interaction used in both practice or assessment contexts.\n- _Objective_: A learning objective that course content attempts to instruct and that activities offer\n  practice and assessment on.\n- _Tag_: A tag is a flexible mechanism that can power a variety of platform functionality such as\n  activity bank selection.\n\nActivities have several important concepts:\n\n- _Activity type_: Torus supports a variety of different kinds of student interactive experiences\n  such as multiple choice, ordering, and check all that apply.\n- _Activity instance_: An activity instance is created when an author defines (aka \"authors\") a new\n  activity of a supported activity type.\n- _Activity reference_: Activity instances are not directly embedded into pages, rather a reference\n  to an instance is stored within pages. This mechanism allows activity instances to be shared\n  across pages.\n- _Activity bank_: A collection of activity instances that can be randomly selected according to\n  a defined set of criteria at delivery time. A page can contain _activity bank selections_ which\n  allows the system to select and render different activities for each different student attempt.\n- _Parts_: Activity instances have a collection of one or more _parts_. A part offers a mechanism\n  to track student interaction and submission, and ultimately to store a system or instructor\n  assign score. Some activity types have a fixed number of parts: for example a multiple choice activity\n  has only one part which models which choice the student selected, their received score and any\n  received feedback. Other activity types feature multiple parts, and in some cases the number of\n  parts is dynamic and determined at the time that the author defines the activity instance. For\n  example, an author can create a \"Multi input\" activity that features three \"fill in the blank\"\n  text inputs in the middle of the question stem. This activity instance would have three parts, one\n  for each of these inputs, and allows each of them to be scored individually.\n- _Grading approach_: Each part within an activity instance can specify its required grading, or scoring, approach. The supported options are `automatic` and `manual`. Automatically scored\n  parts require the definition of a collection of `responses` that specify the rules to use\n  to allow the sytem to perform automatic scoring. Manually scored parts for activities ultimately\n  require the instructor to review the submission for the part and to assign a score and provide\n  feedback.","ref":"overview-1.html#important-concepts-and-terms"},{"type":"extras","title":"LTI 1.3","doc":"# LTI 1.3","ref":"implementing.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"LTI 1.3 Launch Overview - LTI 1.3","doc":"This is a summary of the LTI 1.3 handshake outlined in the IMS Security Framework 1.0 Specification ([5.1 Platform-Originating Messages](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#platform-originating-messages)) geared toward elixir developers who wish to implement LTI 1.3 in their apps.

Many of the necessary features of course delivery such as roster management, grade book management and scheduling are deferred to the LMS, which is what it is specifically designed for. These aspects of the student and instructor experience are crucial and require tight integration which is enabled by the LTI 1.3 standard.\n\nMany LMSs currently support the LTI 1.3 standard including Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, Brightspace D2L, and more. Each LMS may have a slightly different method of configuring an external tool like Torus, but in general the process is similar between them and is driven by the [LTI 1.3 Specification](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/).","ref":"config.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Concepts - LTI 1.3 Configuration","doc":"","ref":"config.html#concepts"},{"type":"extras","title":"Institutions - LTI 1.3 Configuration","doc":"Torus has the concept of an **Institution** which represents an organization whom wishes to use Torus, typically from their own self-hosted LMS or a cloud-hosted one.

The combination of `issuer` (typically a URL e.g. https://canvas.oli.cmu.edu) and `client_id` represents a globally unique registration. The issuer represents the LTI Platform, not necessarily the institution. For example, `https://canvas.instructure.com` is the issuer that represents any institution who may be using Instructure's cloud platform and the client id represents the specific registration, and therefore institution.","ref":"config.html#registrations"},{"type":"extras","title":"Deployments - LTI 1.3 Configuration","doc":"A **Deployment** can be thought of as the next tier below registrations.

The most usual implementation\nof a creation function is to simply return (i.e. resolve) a default\nactivity model.  But given the async interface here, a creation function\ncan have a more interesting implementation where it makes a network request\nto a third-party server to retrieve data to use in constructing the\nactivity instance.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| :------ | :------ | :------ |\n| `manifest` | [`Manifest`](modules.md#manifest) | manifest file JSON |\n| `fn` | [`creationFn`](modules.md#creationfn) | the creation function to use |\n\n#### Returns\n\n`void`\n\n#### Defined in\n\n[src/components/activities/creation.ts:18](https://github.com/Simon-Initiative/oli-torus/blob/c537709/assets/src/components/activities/creation.ts#L18)","ref":"modules.html#registercreationfunc"},{"type":"extras","title":"ActivityContext","doc":"[oli](../README.md) / [Exports](../modules.md) / ActivityContext\n\n# Interface: ActivityContext","ref":"activitycontext.html"},{"type":"extras","title":"Table of contents -
