The most flexible and straightforward solution is to configure Torus behind a proxy using the HTTP_PORT config set to whichever port you intend to point to from your proxy.

This includes using type aliases, union and intersection types, discriminated union types, and utility types ( Partial&lt;Type&gt; , Readonly&lt;Type&gt; , etc). Developers should add TypeScript type annotations to all new code. Developers should use the TypeScript type construct over an interface for all cases except for when extensibility is needed. For example, a type cannot be used in the following: interface Identifiable { id: string; } export interface Paragraph extends Identifiable { type: &quot;p&quot;; } Async code Async code should be written using standard ES6 Promise support or async/await features. Functional programming Code should be written in a functional programming style, leveraging first-class functions, programming as transformation, immutability, pure functions, etc. Immutability Code should be written leveraging immutable data structures and techniques as must as possible, this is particular importance in React-based UI code. Legacy Echo code that ports existing Immutable.js code can stay as-is, but new code that needs immutable data structures should be written using Immer.js. Developers can use the Object.assign({}, current, update) pattern as well. Programming as transformation For conciseness and readability, Code should make heavy use of map and reduce style data transformations instead of imperative loops and similar constructs.

This approach only scales so far, thus for more complicated applications developers should fall back to a third-party library for global state management.

The reasoning here is that since actual page content itself has changed the system should give all new activity attempts to allow the student to see these activities in the context of the latest page content. Only activity revisions have changed. In this case, a new activity attempt will be created for each of only the changed activities. No new page attempt is created.

Delivery : Delivery mode is a set of features used by Instructors and Students during the delivery of course material to students in a course section. The material with course projects is modeled as a collection of Resources of different supported resource types. The following lists the various types of resources that exist: Container : A collection of pages or containers that can correspond to &quot;Units&quot; or &quot;Modules&quot; within a course. Page : A collection of content and activities that offer student instruction and assessment. Pages can be either &quot;graded&quot; or &quot;practice&quot;. Activity : A scorable interaction used in both practice or assessment contexts. Objective : A learning objective that course content attempts to instruct and that activities offer practice and assessment on. Tag : A tag is a flexible mechanism that can power a variety of platform functionality such as activity bank selection. Activities have several important concepts: Activity type : Torus supports a variety of different kinds of student interactive experiences such as multiple choice, ordering, and check all that apply. Activity instance : An activity instance is created when an author defines (aka &quot;authors&quot;) a new activity of a supported activity type. Activity reference : Activity instances are not directly embedded into pages, rather a reference to an instance is stored within pages. This mechanism allows activity instances to be shared across pages. Activity bank : A collection of activity instances that can be randomly selected according to a defined set of criteria at delivery time. A page can contain activity bank selections which allows the system to select and render different activities for each different student attempt. Parts : Activity instances have a collection of one or more parts . A part offers a mechanism to track student interaction and submission, and ultimately to store a system or instructor assign score. Some activity types have a fixed number of parts: for example a multiple choice activity has only one part which models which choice the student selected, their received score and any received feedback. Other activity types feature multiple parts, and in some cases the number of parts is dynamic and determined at the time that the author defines the activity instance. For example, an author can create a &quot;Multi input&quot; activity that features three &quot;fill in the blank&quot; text inputs in the middle of the question stem. This activity instance would have three parts, one for each of these inputs, and allows each of them to be scored individually. Grading approach : Each part within an activity instance can specify its required grading, or scoring, approach. The supported options are automatic and manual . Automatically scored parts require the definition of a collection of responses that specify the rules to use to allow the sytem to perform automatic scoring. Manually scored parts for activities ultimately require the instructor to review the submission for the part and to assign a score and provide feedback.","ref":"overview.html#important-concepts-and-terms","title":"Overview - Important concepts and terms","type":"extras"},{"doc":"","ref":"implementing.html","title":"LTI 1.3","type":"extras"},{"doc":"This is a summary of the LTI 1.3 handshake outlined in the IMS Security Framework 1.0 Specification ( 5.1 Platform-Originating Messages ) geared toward elixir developers who wish to implement LTI 1.3 in their apps.

For example, this form will target the iframe below it: controller.ex launch_params = %{ # client_id must match the value registered with the tool client_id : &quot;1000000000001&quot; , # issuer value associated with the plaform iss : &quot;https://platform.example.edu&quot; , # tool OIDC login path, the destination this request will be sent to oidc_login_url : &quot;https://tool.example.edu/login&quot; , # the location of the requested LTI resource target_link_uri : &quot;https://tool.example.edu/launch&quot; , # unique token used later by the platform to associate the request with this user session login_hint : &quot;ac5cdc6e-1dd2-97f2-e2c8-0d4236e9b092&quot; , } render ( conn , &quot;lti_launch.html&quot; , launch_params : launch_params ) lti_launch.html.eex &lt;form action=&quot;&lt;%= @launch_params.oidc_login_url %&gt;&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; target=&quot;tool_content&quot; &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;iss&quot; id=&quot;iss&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @launch_params.iss %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;login_hint&quot; id=&quot;login_hint&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @launch_params.login_hint %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;client_id&quot; id=&quot;client_id&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @launch_params.client_id %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;target_link_uri&quot; id=&quot;target_link_uri&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @launch_params.target_link_uri %&gt;&quot; /&gt; &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Launch LTI 1.3 Tool&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;about:blank&quot; name=&quot;tool_content&quot; title=&quot;Tool Content&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; When a user clicks the &quot;Launch LTI 1.3 Tool&quot; button the form request will be sent to the tool's OIDC login endpoint and the LTI 1.3 handshake will begin. Step 2: Authentication Request https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-2-authentication-request When the request is recieved, the tool will validate the issuer and client_id match the registered platform, validate the login_hint param is present and issue a redirect to the platform's OIDC (OpenID Connect) endpoint to authenticate the user. If validation is successful, the tool will craft the OIDC request with the following parameters: %{ # OIDC and LTI 1.3 required params &quot;scope&quot; = &gt; &quot;openid&quot; , &quot;response_type&quot; = &gt; &quot;id_token&quot; , &quot;response_mode&quot; = &gt; &quot;form_post&quot; , &quot;prompt&quot; = &gt; &quot;none&quot; , # client_id that was given by POST params, also associated with the platform registration &quot;client_id&quot; = &gt; &quot;some-client-id&quot; , # the tool url to redirect back to after successful login &quot;redirect_uri&quot; = &gt; &quot;some-redirect_uri&quot; , # unique token associated with this request and used later to prevent CSRF &quot;state&quot; = &gt; &quot;some-unique-token&quot; , # unique identifier cached by the platform to prevent replay attacks &quot;nonce&quot; = &gt; &quot;some-unique-nonce&quot; , # opaque string used by the platform to validate the user session associated with the request &quot;login_hint&quot; = &gt; &quot;some-login-hint&quot; , } For example, the final request using GET to the platform will look something like: GET /authorize_redirect?scope=openid&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;... etc. Step 3: Authentication Response https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-3-authentication-response The platform will recieve the authorize_redirect request from the tool and it will validate the required OIDC params are present, validate the login_hint is associated with the current user session, validate the client_id is associated with a registered tool, validate the redirect_url matches one of the registered urls, and finally validate the nonce has not been used before. If valid, the platform will issue one final POST request to the tool's specified redirect_uri with the recieved state token and an id_token JWT containing the LTI 1.3 claims such as user details, context info, and any other LTI specific or custom claims that may be supported by the platform. Here is an example of the LTI params within the id_token JWT.

The philosophy of Torus is to focus and excel at what it is specifically designed for, which is rich course content authoring, delivery and data-driven continuous improvement. Many of the necessary features of course delivery such as roster management, grade book management and scheduling are deferred to the LMS, which is what it is specifically designed for. These aspects of the student and instructor experience are crucial and require tight integration which is enabled by the LTI 1.3 standard. Many LMSs currently support the LTI 1.3 standard including Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, Brightspace D2L, and more. Each LMS may have a slightly different method of configuring an external tool like Torus, but in general the process is similar between them and is driven by the LTI 1.3 Specification .","ref":"config.html","title":"LTI 1.3 Configuration","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Institutions Torus has the concept of an Institution which represents an organization whom wishes to use Torus, typically from their own self-hosted LMS or a cloud-hosted one. For example, Carnegie Mellon University would be considered an institution, and so is The Open Learning Initiative (OLI). Registrations A Registration represents a configured LTI connection from an institution in Torus. Typically an institution will have a single registration but there may be certain cases where an institution has multiple registrations could be an institution that has multiple LMSs. Each one of these LMSs may belong to the same Institution but will have separate registrations. The combination of issuer (typically a URL e.g. https://canvas.oli.cmu.edu ) and client_id represents a globally unique registration. The issuer represents the LTI Platform, not necessarily the institution. For example, https://canvas.instructure.com is the issuer that represents any institution who may be using Instructure's cloud platform and the client id represents the specific registration, and therefore institution. Deployments A Deployment can be thought of as the next tier below registrations. A registration may have many deployments. For example, a Registration may have one deployment for every course, or a single deployment shared globally across the entire LMS. There is some flexibility to how these concepts could be represented for an organization, but typically an organization will have a single Institution , with a single Registration for their LMS, and they may have one or many Deployments within their LMS depending on if the tool is configure globally or for an individual department/course. Institutions, registrations and deployments are currently created and managed by a Torus administrator. In the future, we plan to add more flexibility on how these entities can be registered and approved. For now, please contact OLI if you wish to deliver a Torus course from your organization's LMS. If you are running your own instance of Torus, the steps below outline the process for creating these entities required for LTI 1.3 integration with an LMS.","ref":"config.html#concepts","title":"LTI 1.3 Configuration - Concepts","type":"extras"},{"doc":"To get connected with Torus, you must first configure your LMS LTI 1.3 connection.

This simply means that an author of a course, when inserting an image into a page can choose to either upload an image file to Torus to use (thus, &quot;interally hosted&quot;) or to copy and paste a URL of a publicly available image to use (thus, &quot;externally hosted&quot;). For internally hosted assets, Torus does several things with that media asset to both ensure correct and efficient delivery of a course project and to enable a richer authoring experience: Deduplication: Upload receiving the uplaod of an asset, Torus calculates an MD5 hash and compares it all other assets of that course to prevent duplicate images from being added into the system. Cached, immutable storage: Once the asset is guaranteed to be unique, Torus stores it in AWS S3 storage, where it can be directly accessible via a URL. At this point, the asset is immutable: it cannot be updated or deleted by a Torus end user. This is necessary to allow proper functioning of the Torus publication model. See the Immutability section below for a use case that demonstrates this importance. The S3 buckets are fronted by an AWS edge caching solution. Project assocation: Meta-data regarding the asset is associated with the course project, primarily to power the &quot;Media Library&quot; feature within Torus. An author can then browse their media library within Torus to select the asset for use in other places within their course project. For externally hosted asset references, Torus does none of the above. It simply allows that external URL to be embedded in the content of the page and the activity.","ref":"media.html#external-vs-internal-media-asset-storage","title":"Media assets - External vs Internal Media Asset Storage","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Immutability of media assets is paramount to correct delivery of a course project as that course project evolves over time. The lack of an immutability guarantee for externally hosted assets can cause &quot;change leakage&quot; problems. Consider the following scenario: An author embeds a reference to an externally hosted image in a page in their course. Perhaps the author has a blog where they have images and other assets present. Course sections are created and students begin to access the course material. The author then decides to begin editing their course material to prepare for a major revision that they will publish in a few months for the next semester of course sections. The author deems it necessary to update several of the images hosted on their blog to support these course material updates. While the Torus course material updates will not be visible to students (since the author hasn't &quot;Published&quot; those changes yet), as soon as the author changes those images, students working through the active course section see the new, updated images.","ref":"media.html#immutability","title":"Media assets - Immutability","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Developers creating course digests to ingest into Torus can choose to take advantage of Torus &quot;internally hosted&quot; assets and the media library feature. Asset URL references within pages and activities must use the Torus AWS URL prefixes, so that at runtime these reference resolve to the correct Torus asset location. The format of the URL is https://d2xvti2irp4c7t.cloudfront.net/media/${project_slug}/${file_name} , where project_slug is a unique project identifier (not necessarily the actual project slug that will get generated, more so simply a folder name) and file_name of course is the name of the file corresponding to the asset. Every asset in a course project that is intended to be tracked by Torus in the media library must have an entry in the _media_manifest.json file of the course digest. Before or after a course digest has been ingested, the actual media assets themselves need to be &quot;staged&quot; in the Torus AWS S3 instance. Once both the digest has been ingested and the assets staged, an author can begin accessing and editing the newly ingested course and be able to view the existing assets in pages. Furthermore, the author is able to browse the library of all asssets via the Media Library capability.","ref":"media.html#asset-considerations-for-course-ingestion","title":"Media assets - Asset Considerations for Course Ingestion","type":"extras"},{"doc":"The OLI Legacy course digest tool ( https://github.com/Simon-Initiative/course-digest ) contains an asset staging implementation that developers of other digests can reuse.

The implementation simply uploads, serially, the files in the manifest into the Torus AWS S3 storage.
