You will also desigexperiments to measure the concentration of sucrose.<ul><li>The Coca-Cola Company long ago decided not to patent its formula, but instead protected threcipe as a &quot;trade secret&quot; so no one else could copy it. While writing a book about the companentitled &quot;For God, Country, and Coca-Cola,&quot; Mark Pendergrast believed he came across thformula (called Formula X) and published it. It contains 30 lbs of sugar in 2.5 gallons of water.<brPrepare this solution in the Virtual Lab and calculate its sucrose concentration in mass percent, molarity, molality and mole fraction</li><li>The virtual lab stockroom contains a sample of a 'Generic Brand Cola'. Design and perforexperiments to determine the sucrose concentration. Give you answer in mass percent, molarity,molality and mole fraction. [Hint: compare the density of your &quot;Formula X&quot; solution with that of pure water.]</li><li>Does the generic brand have more or less sugar than 'Formula X'? </li></ul>"
