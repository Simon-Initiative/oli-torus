/**
 * This will generate rules for a screen that has three attempts to get it right with appropriate feedback loops.
 *
 * Rules include:
 *
 * [A correct rule to catch the learner doing it right - with correct feedback and navigation]
 * [Catch a blank response, give feedback, reset the current attempt count]
 *  [A common-error rule for each common error that has navigation (and possibly feedback)]
 * [A rule to catch 3-incorrect answers, gives feedback, sets the correct answer, navigates]
 *  [A common-error rule for each common error that has no navigation but does have feedback]
 * [A first/second-attempt general incorrect rule with feedback, no nav]
 * [A generic default incorrect rule with feedback, no nav]
 *
 *
 *
 * @param correct - Condition, feedback, and destination to go to for a correct answer.
 * @param incorrect  - Condition, feedback, and destination to go to for an incorrect answer.
 * @param commonErrors  - A condition for each common error, it must have either feedback or a destination, and can have both.
 * @param setCorrectAction - an IAction that sets the question on screen to the correct answer.
 * @param blankCondition - A condition that checks if the question is currently blank.
 * @param disableAction - An action that disables the question on screen. This is used when the user is about to be forced to a screen so they don't think they should go and try again
