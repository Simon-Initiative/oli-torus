# Torus components

Listed in this storybook are common Torus react based components.

You can view documentation on them from the **Docs** tab and see them in action from the **Canvas** tab. Dark mode is only supported in the Canvas tab.

<div class="bg-purple-100 rounded-lg py-5 px-6 mb-4 text-base text-purple-700 mb-3" role="alert">
  The documentation on the <b>docs</b> tab will often be the most useful, but is not the default.
</div>

# Running locally

You can run this storybook locally with `yarn storybook` from within the assets folder.

When you do, most changes will live-reload as you edit components. However, if you use a tailwind class that hadn't
been used previously, you will have to reload the entire page to see the changes.
