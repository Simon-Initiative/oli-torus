# WW-TORUS-E2E

This platform contains the automated e2e tests.

## 🔑 Runtime configuration (no .env files)

- Playwright config uses a fixed `baseURL` of `http://localhost` (see `playwright.config.ts`). Adjust there if you target another host.
- Each spec defines its own runtime login data (emails, passwords, names) and seeds its own YAML scenario in `beforeAll`, using a per-run `RUN_ID` to avoid collisions.
- Scenario seeding is authenticated with a default token of `my-token`; change this in the spec runtime config and in your Phoenix `PLAYWRIGHT_SCENARIO_TOKEN` if needed.
- Browser auto-close behavior is controlled by runtime config in specs (defaults to keep the browser open between tests).

## 🧪 Configuration Tests & Report

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Run the configuration for testing

```bash
npm run test-config
```

Run it in headed mode (visible browser)

```bash
npm run test-config:headed
```

Open the latest Playwright HTML report

```bash
npm run show-report
```

## 🤖 Automated Configurations

These configurations are executed **before running the tests** and are already automated.  
The following processes are included.

### 📁 Project Creation

Course authoring scenarios create projects with names suffixed by the current `RUN_ID` (e.g., `TQA-10-automation-1700000000000`).

### 🎨 Multimedia File Configuration

The upload of multimedia resources is automated for the following projects (names include the `RUN_ID` suffix):

| 📂 Project Name            | 📄 File Name            | 🏷️ Type |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------ |
