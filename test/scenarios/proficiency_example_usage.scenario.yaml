# Example: Using the Proficiency Base Scenario
# This demonstrates how to include the proficiency_base scenario using the "use" directive

# Include the base proficiency scenario
# This creates the project, pages, activities, and section
- use:
    file: "proficiency_base.scenario.yaml"

# Now we can extend or work with the structures created by proficiency_base
# For example, let's create a student and have them interact with the content

# Create a student user
- user:
    name: "alice"
    type: "student"
    email: "alice@example.edu"

# Enroll the student in the section created by proficiency_base
- enroll:
    user: "alice"
    section: "proficiency_section"
    role: "student"

# Have the student view one of the pages
- view_practice_page:
    student: "alice"
    section: "proficiency_section"
    page: "Lesson 1.1: Introduction"

# Create an instructor
- user:
    name: "prof_smith"
    type: "author"
    email: "prof.smith@example.edu"

# Verify the section still has the expected structure
- assert:
    structure:
      to: "proficiency_section"
      root:
        children:
          - container: "Unit 1: Fundamentals"
            children:
              - page: "Lesson 1.1: Introduction"
              - page: "Lesson 1.2: Basic Concepts"
              - page: "Lesson 1.3: Practice Fundamentals"
          - container: "Unit 2: Advanced Topics"
            children:
              - page: "Lesson 2.1: Complex Applications"
              - page: "Lesson 2.2: Expert Techniques"
              - page: "Lesson 2.3: Advanced Practice"
