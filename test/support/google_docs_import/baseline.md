# Getting Started with Cloud Security

Welcome to the security primer. This document outlines the minimum concepts an admin should review prior to importing content into Torus.

## Why Security Matters

Cloud platforms reduce **operational overhead** while improving _time to market_. However, they also expand the potential attack surface.

### Key Responsibilities

- Harden access keys and rotate them quarterly.
- Monitor audit trails; alert on anomalous logins.
- Document shared responsibility agreements with providers.

1. Establish an incident response playbook.
2. Run tabletop exercises every six months.
3. Track post-incident follow-up actions.

> Remember: visibility is the foundation of a resilient cloud posture.
