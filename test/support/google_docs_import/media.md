# Media Library Smoke Test

This sample exercises the image ingestion path by embedding data URLs that should be decoded, deduplicated, and uploaded into the Torus media library.

The same binary appears again below and should trigger the hash-based reuse behaviour rather than a second upload.

Supplemental guidance:

- Validate the importer warns when an image exceeds 5â€¯MB.
- If uploads fail, fall back to the original data URL and surface a warning.
- Capture telemetry for `uploaded_media_count`, `media_bytes`, and dedupe hits.

All binaries have their base64 encoded data at the end of the document.
