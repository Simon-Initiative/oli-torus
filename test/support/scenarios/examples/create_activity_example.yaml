        A car travels at a constant velocity of 60 km/h for 2 hours.
        
        What is the total distance traveled?

        - body_md: "The velocity is 60 km/h and the time is 2 hours"
      
      explanation_md: |
        The distance traveled at constant velocity is calculated using:
        
        **d = v × t**
        
        Where:
        - d = distance
        - v = velocity = 60 km/h
        - t = time = 2 h
        
        Therefore: d = 60 km/h × 2 h = 120 km

        Use the equation: v = v₀ + at
        Since the object starts from rest, v₀ = 0
