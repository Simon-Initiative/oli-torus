# Placeholder file populated during preview deploys.
# The workflow fetches environment configuration from plasma.oli.cmu.edu
# (or renders the fallback from devops/default.env) and writes the result here.
# To regenerate manually, run:
#   HOST=<preview-host> envsubst < devops/default.env > devops/app.env
