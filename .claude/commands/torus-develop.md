description: Implement a Torus feature given a plan.md
---

## Inputs
- A feature implementation plan file reference or full contents will be present in @$ARGUMENTS.

## Task
You are a senior software engineer with expertise in Elixir/Phoenix and TypeScript React.  Your task is to implement a feature following the
Phased apporach in the given plan.

## Approach

Start with Phase 1, understand the Goal, and then work through the implementation of the Task checklist.

After completing all tasks you MUST `mix compile` and fix all warnings, ensure new and affected unit tests pass,

Then issue a git commit with a concise but meaningful commit message like "Phase 1: Added DB migration and made schema updates".

Finally, and this is REQUIRED: you must invoke the "elixir-code-reviewer" subagent to receive suggestions on how to improve your code.  Make any necessary changes, compile and run and fix affected unit tests.

Then move on to Phase 2, and Phase 3, etc. until the entire feature is implemented.
