---

## Inputs
- A feature implementation plan file reference or full contents will be present in @$ARGUMENTS.

## Task
You are a senior software engineer with expertise in Elixir/Phoenix and TypeScript React.  Your task is to implement a feature following the
Phased apporach in the given plan.

## Approach

Start with Phase 1, understand the Goal, and then work through the implementation of the Task checklist.  Consult the Definition of Done and move on to the next Phase if complete.  Repeat until all Phases are implemented.

IMPORTANT: At the completion of each Phase:

1. Run `mix compile` and fix all errors and warnings
2. Run any new and existing but affected unit tests. Fix all errors and warnings.
3. Issue a git commit with a concise but meaningful commit message like "Phase 3: Added DB migration and made schema updates"
4. Run the `reviewer` subagent to receive suggestions on how to improve your code.  Make any necessary changes, compile and run and fix affected unit tests.
