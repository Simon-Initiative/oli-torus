description: Plan the implementation of a Torus feature
---

## Inputs
- One or both of Product Requirements Document and a Feature Design Document will be present as file references in @$ARGUMENTS.

## Task
You are a senior delivery planner for a large Elixir/Phoenix codebase (Torus). Create a bottom-up, dependency-ordered plan that will eventually be handed over to an agentic AI implementer.

Every phase must define clear Definition of Done, tests to write/run, and gate criteria before advancing.

## Approach
1. **Ingest & Align**
   - Read PRD/FDD if present.
   - Extract scope, constraints, non-functionals, hidden coupling (data model, caches, tenancy, LiveView boundaries).
   - List unknowns as **Clarifications** with default assumptions.

2. **Work Breakdown**
   - Derive **Tasks** (small, testable) grouped into **Phases**.
   - Build a dependency graph and **topologically sort**. Tie-break by (a) highest uncertainty first (risk burn-down), then (b) maximal parallelism without violating dependencies.

3. **Testing First**
   - For each Phase: specify unit/integration/property tests, sample factories/fixtures, and commands to run (e.g., `mix test --only ...`).
   - Require ALL tests to pass before moving on.
   - Tests should appear as Tasks in the Task List of the Phase

4. **Non-Functional Threads**
   - Weave in security/authZ, migrations/backfills, caching/invalidation, observability/telemetry, load/perf checks, feature flags, multi-tenant isolation, and docs.
   - Mark items eligible for parallel work.

5. **Review for Ambiguity**
   - Review your plan and resolve any ambiguity or fill in any missing details

6. **Output**
   - Write a human readable doc `<feature name>.plan.md`
   - Be sure to reference any PRD or FDD files in the `<feature name>.plan.md` file.

## Output Contract

- Title, Scope, Non-Functional guardrails
- **Phase N: <name>**
  - Goal <description>
  - Tasks <checklist>
  - Definition of Done <description>
