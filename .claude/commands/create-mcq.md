Author and create the Torus multiple choice activity described as: "$ARGUMENTS".

1) Seek to understand the structure and schema for the mcq activity type.
2) Author a question stem, then a correct answer, then think hard to generate 2 or 3 useful distractors that likely represent common misconceptions.
3) Author three hints, with the third hint being a "bottom out" hint which basically gives away the answer.
4) Create a response and feedback for the correct answer and each of the distrctors.  IT IS IMPORTANT to also
include one extra response as a "catch all" whose rule is "input like {.*}" with generic feedback of "Incorrect."
5) Validate the JSON
6) Create the activity.

The course project slug is "example_course".
