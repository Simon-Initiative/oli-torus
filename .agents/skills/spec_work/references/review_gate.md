# Review Gate

`spec_work` is a two-step conversational lane.

## Step 1: Brief Plan Review
Present:
- Brief technical approach (2-4 sentences and a short bullet list).
- Brief numbered plan (3-6 steps).
- Risks, assumptions, and test strategy.

## Step 2: Approval to Implement
Implement when user gives any clear positive confirmation, such as:
- "yes"
- "looks good"
- "proceed"
- "now implement it"

If user requests changes, revise and re-present Step 1 before implementation.
