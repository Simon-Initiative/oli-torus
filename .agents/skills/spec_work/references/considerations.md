# Considerations

- Keep enhancement scope ticket-sized and explicitly state out-of-scope in chat.
- Use Jira ticket fields and engineering comments as primary requirements source.
- When epic context exists, align implementation decisions with epic constraints.
- Keep technical approach and plan intentionally short; avoid verbose spec drafting.
- Require explicit user approval before implementing.
- Preserve tenant/authz/security expectations and avoid broad refactors.
- Include test strategy and rollout/rollback notes in execution summary.
