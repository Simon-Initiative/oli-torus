# Slice Design Checklist

- Use sections from `assets/templates/design_slice_template.md`.
- Keep slice scope tight; defer unrelated work.
- Include explicit AC-to-slice mapping with IDs.
- Include concrete function/interface signatures.
- Cover edge cases and error behavior.
- Include a test plan for happy and failure paths.
- Remove unresolved `TODO`/`TBD`/`FIXME` markers.
