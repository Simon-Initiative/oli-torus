# Plan Checklist

- Use numbered phase headings (`## Phase <n>:`).
- Every phase must include:
  - Goal
  - Task checklist
  - Verification checklist
  - Definition of Done
  - Gate
- Identify dependency order and safe parallel work.
- Include non-functional guardrails and rollout assumptions.
- Remove unresolved `TODO`/`TBD`/`FIXME` markers.
