# PRD Checklist

Use this checklist before saving `prd.md`:

- Keep required headings from `assets/templates/prd_template.md`.
- Use `FR-###` IDs in the Functional Requirements table.
- Use `AC-### (FR-###)` in Given/When/Then format.
- Ensure at least one acceptance criterion exists.
- Make scope boundaries explicit (goals vs non-goals).
- Include role/permission expectations.
- Include rollout and rollback notes.
- Include measurable non-functional budgets when relevant.
- Remove unresolved `TODO`/`TBD`/`FIXME` markers.
