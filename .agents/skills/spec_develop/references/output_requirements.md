# Output Requirements (Development Run)

At completion, report:

- Implemented feature path and phase(s) executed.
- Key files changed.
- Commands run (`mix compile`, tests, validation) and outcomes.
- Self-review rounds completed and findings resolved.
- Any spec-sync updates made to `prd.md`, `fdd.md`, or `plan.md`.
- Remaining risks or explicit follow-ups.

## Phase Completion Requirements

A phase is complete only when all are true:

- Scoped phase tasks are implemented.
- `mix compile` passes with no warnings.
- New and affected tests pass.
- At least one `self_review` round is executed after compile/tests.
- High/medium review findings are fixed (or explicitly documented with rationale).
