# Development Checklist

- Confirm selected phase tasks and dependencies from `plan.md`.
- Implement only the scoped phase; defer extras.
- Update tests in the same change set as behavior changes.
- Run compile and targeted/full tests.
- Run mandatory self-review loop and fix findings.
- Update PRD/FDD/plan when implementation reality changes.
- Remove unresolved `TODO`/`TBD`/`FIXME` markers in touched files.
