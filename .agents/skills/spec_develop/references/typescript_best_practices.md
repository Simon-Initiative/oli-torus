# TypeScript Best Practices (Spec Develop)

- Keep React components functional and state minimal.
- Model API payloads with explicit types; avoid `any`.
- Keep side effects in hooks with deterministic dependencies.
- Preserve existing design system and accessibility semantics.
- Add tests for user-visible state transitions and error states.
- Keep client/server contract assumptions explicit in docs and code.
