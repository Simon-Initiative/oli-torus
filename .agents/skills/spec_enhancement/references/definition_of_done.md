# Definition of Done

An enhancement is done only when all checks below pass:

- Enhancement doc exists in the correct lane path.
- Required headings are present and populated.
- Acceptance criteria are testable and scoped.
- No unresolved `TODO` / `TBD` / `FIXME` markers remain.
- Validation gates pass:
  - Enhancement doc validation always.
  - Full spec-pack validation when operating in `docs/features/<feature_slug>/`.
- Implementation and tests align with acceptance criteria.
- Rollout notes are explicit (or explicitly state not needed).
