# Enhancement Checklist

- Use all sections from `assets/templates/enhancement_template.md`.
- Keep scope ticket-sized; explicitly list out-of-scope items.
- Write acceptance criteria as testable statements with IDs (`AC-001`, `AC-002`, ...).
- Include concrete risks and mitigation notes.
- Include explicit test plan (unit/integration/manual as applicable).
- Include rollout and rollback notes, even if "none needed".
- Remove unresolved `TODO` / `TBD` / `FIXME` markers.
