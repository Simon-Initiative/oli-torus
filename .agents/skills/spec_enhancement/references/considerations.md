# Considerations

- Keep enhancement scope ticket-sized and explicitly document out-of-scope.
- Favor reuse of existing feature packs when behavior belongs to an active spec lane.
- Maintain testable acceptance criteria and role/tenant safety boundaries.
- Include rollout/rollback posture even for small changes.
- Capture data/API side effects and migration implications when relevant.
- Ensure validation gates run before and after implementation doc updates.
