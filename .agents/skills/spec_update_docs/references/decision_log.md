# Decision Log Rule

When a spec doc is materially changed, add a decision entry to that file.

Preferred placement:

- Append under existing `## Decision Log` heading.
- If missing, add `## Decision Log` near the end of the file.

Entry format:

- Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Change summary
- Why change was needed (link to code/test/migration evidence)
- Impact on acceptance criteria or plan mapping
