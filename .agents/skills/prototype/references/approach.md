# Approach

1. Define the prototype question being answered and a concrete success signal.
2. Timebox implementation and focus on one runnable path.
3. Build the thinnest vertical slice that demonstrates the core idea.
4. Validate by running and manually exercising the path.
5. Capture limitations and explicit next steps for production hardening.
