defmodule Oli.Delivery.Attempts.PageLifecycle.GradeUpdateWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  An Oban worker driven LMS grade update.

  Called via the `create` function, which takes a resource access id and an update type (:inline, :manual, :manual_batch).

  This works by first fetching the `%ResourceAccess` record, and then posts the score and out_of found their
  to the line item in the LMS. The line item is created if it doesn't already exist. Success and failure are tracked
  via `%LMSGradeUpdate` records which hang off of the `%ResourceAccess` record.

  It is important that we fetch the ResourceAccess record just in time to make this robust to the chance that students can be finalizing
  additional attempts prior to the execution of this (potentially) deferred job.  An example series of events that can easily
  lead to this situation:

  1. Student completes their first attempt and receives a 7/10.
  2. This job executes, but fails (say due to a network timeout).  The job is rescheduled for a second attempt.
  3. Meanwhile, the student - not satisfied with a 7/10 - takes and finishes a second attempt receiving 9/10.
  4. Our Oban infrastructure detects this new job to be a duplicate of an existing and simply merges the two jobs.
  5. When the original job finally executes in its second attempt, the "just in time" read of the %ResourceAccess record
     results in the correct grade (9/10) being sent.

  Create a grade update worker, given a resource_access_id and a job type.  The job type

  Emits broadcasted PubSub events to allow client code to monitor the lifecycle of the grade update.
  The status events emitted are: `[:queued, :running, :success, :failure, :not_synced, :retrying]`

  - `:queued`: The grade update request is queued for its initial execution
  - `:running`: The grade update request has started execution
  - `:success`: The grade update request succeeded
  - `:failure`: The grade update request failed permanently after exhausting all retry attempts
  - `:not_synced`: The grade update request was not actually run due to LMS grade passback not being enabled
  - `:retrying`: The grade update request failed, but is queued for a retry
