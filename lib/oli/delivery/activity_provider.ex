  Realizes and resolves activities in a page.

  For advanced delivery pages this impl finds all activity-reference instances from within the entire
  nested tree of the content model.  For basic delivery, we traverse the entire hierarchy of the page
  content, tracking groups and surveys, and processing selections as well as static activity-reference instances.

  Activities are realized in different ways, depending on the type of reference. First, a static
  reference to an activity (via "activity-reference") is simply resolved to the correct published
  resource. A second type of reference is a selection from the activity bank (via "selection" element).
  These are realized by fulfilling the selection (i.e. drawing the required number of activities randomly
  from the bank according to defined criteria).

  Activity realization can change the content of the page revision. This is true currently only for
  selections.  The selection element from within the page must be replaced by static activity references
  (which later then drive rendering).

  Returns a %Oli.Delivery.ActivityProvider.Result{}, which contains a list of any errors, the provided
  activity attempt prototypes, and the transformed page model.

  Parameters for provide are:
  1. The page revision that we are providing activities for
  2. The source through which we provide activities
  3. A list of pre-existing attempt prototypes that constrain the activity realization
  4. The resolver to use
