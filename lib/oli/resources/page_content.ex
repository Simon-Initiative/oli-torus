  Modelled after `Enum.map_reduce`, this invokes the given function to each content element in a page content tree.

  Returns a tuple where the first element is the mapped page content tree
  and the second one is the final accumulator.

  The function, map_fn, receives two arguments: the first one is the element, and the second one is the accumulator.
  map_fn must return a tuple with two elements in the form of {mapped content element, accumulator}.
