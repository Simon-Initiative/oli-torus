        # required to treat student inputs as lists of choice IDs, so each activity had to be treated
        # differently to show the human-friendly student "selection." The downside of showing the
        # raw input string is that the actual choice content seen by the student is not obvious through
        # Datashop without cross-referencing the IDs.
