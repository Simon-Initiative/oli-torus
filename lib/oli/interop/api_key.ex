  @moduledoc """
  A schema for modeling third-party developer API keys.

  We do not store the actual key in the database, instead we treat it like a
  password and only store a hash of the key.

  Keys can have different "scopes" available to them.  All scopes can be enabled
  and disabled via the "status" attribute.

  The "hint" is merely a description that allows a UX to display information about the
  key, like who it was created for and perhaps why it was created.
