  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Purpose of the Study</span>: I know that the researchers are studying how students learn in an online educational environment and that the study is directed at improving the course material, not judging my behaviors. As a result of this research, the researchers will produce design recommendations to improve future versions of the courses. I understand that my interactions with the on-line course will be logged in a data file and that these logs and the scores that I receive on exams will be used as data for this study. The only difference between agreeing to participate in the study and not agreeing to participate in the study is that if I agree to participate, my log file will be retained as data for this study, if I do not agree, my log file will not be retained.</p>

Each participant will be assigned an ID; names will not be logged with the study data. The researchers will save the data using this participant ID. Only registered OLI researchers will have access to the logged data for analysis purposes. The servers containing the log files are in locked secure room. No other researchers will have access to these files.</p>
