    <p>
      I agree to participate in the on-line course research conducted by Norman Bier and his colleagues under
      the supervision of Norman Bier. I understand that the proposed research has been reviewed by the University&apos;s
      Institutional Review Board. I understand that my participation is completely voluntary, and I will not receive
      course credit or any other compensation from Carnegie Mellon for my participation in this research. I understand
      that I have the right to terminate my participation at any time I wish without penalty by selecting
      &quot;opt out from research&quot; on &quot;my OLI home&quot; page.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong> I know that the researchers are studying how students learn in an online
      educational environment and that the study is directed at improving the course material, not judging my behaviors.
      As a result of this research, the researchers will produce design recommendations to improve future versions of
      the courses. I understand that my interactions with the on-line course will be logged in a data file and that these
      logs and the scores that I receive on exams will be used as data for this study. The only difference between
      agreeing to participate in the study and not agreeing to participate in the study is that if I agree to participate,
      my log file will be retained as data for this study, if I do not agree, my log file will not be retained.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Privacy:</strong> I understand that the following procedure will be used to maintain my anonymity in
      analysis and publication / presentation of any results. Each participant will be assigned an ID; names will not be
      logged with the study data. The researchers will save the data using this participant ID. Only registered OLI researchers
      will have access to the logged data for analysis purposes. The servers containing the log files are in locked secure
      room. No other researchers will have access to these files.

      or presentations to advance the knowledge of science and/or academia, without further permission from me provided
      that my image or identity is not disclosed.
